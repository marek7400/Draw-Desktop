LoadIMG: Allows loading an image as a background. The program will automatically switch to EDIT mode with indicators off.

ANIM: Opens the "Animation Configuration" dialog, allowing selection of .json scene files and setting playback parameters.
Animation Configuration
This window allows you to define how a sequence of saved scenes (.json) will be played back. You can control the timing, order, and other aspects of the animation.
Start Delay (s):
Specifies the time in seconds that will elapse from clicking "Start" in this window to the actual start of playback for the first animation scene.
Useful to give yourself time to prepare or switch windows.
Range: 0.0 to 300.0 seconds (with 3 decimal places accuracy).
Automatic Time:
Checkbox. Determines how the display time for individual scenes is managed.
Checked (Automatic Mode):
All scenes will use the values from the "Interval Between Scenes" and "Default Scene Display Time" fields.
Individual times set for scenes in the list below (columns "Time" and "T>") will be ignored.
Unchecked (Manual Mode):
You can define an individual display time for each scene (Time spinbox next to each scene) and an individual interval after each scene (T> checkbox and associated spinbox).
Scenes can also have an individual start time defined (Start Time spinbox).
Interval Between Scenes (s):
Active only in Automatic Mode.
Specifies the pause time (in seconds) between the end of one scene's display and the start of loading the next.
Range: 0.0 to 60.0 seconds (with 4 decimal places accuracy).
Default Scene Display Time (s):
Active only in Automatic Mode.
Specifies the default time (in seconds) for which each scene will be displayed before being cleared (if "Clr?" is checked for it) and the next one is loaded.
Range: 0.001 to 300.0 seconds (with 4 decimal places accuracy).
Load Mode:
Dropdown list specifying in which drawing mode (EDIT or BOARD) the animation scenes will be loaded.
EDIT: Scenes will be loaded with a transparent background, allowing drawing on existing desktop content.
BOARD: Scenes will be loaded in whiteboard mode (white background, unless the scene itself defines another).
Playback Type:
Group of options specifying the order and manner of scene playback:
Play from front: Scenes will be played in the order they appear in the file list.
Play from back: Scenes will be played in reverse order.
Play from front then back (Ping-Pong): Scenes will be played from start to end, then from end to start (without repeating the last and first scenes at the turning point).
Play from back then forward (Ping-Pong): Scenes will be played from end to start, then from start to end.
Loop: Checkbox. If checked, the entire sequence (according to the selected playback type) will be repeated indefinitely.
Scene List:
Displays the list of .json files selected for animation. For each scene, the following options can be configured (some are active only in Manual Mode):
Checkbox (first column, without "All Incl." header):
Include Scene: Check to include this scene in the animation. Unchecking will skip it.
S/H (Show/Hide Preview):
Checkbox. Allows dynamically loading (showing) or removing (hiding) shapes from a given scene on the main desktop during animation configuration. Does not affect the animation playback itself, only the background preview.
Clr? (Clear After?):
Checkbox. If checked, shapes from this scene will be removed from the desktop after its display time has elapsed and before the next scene is loaded. If unchecked, shapes from this scene will remain visible, and shapes from the next scene will be added to them.
Filename: Displays the scene's filename.
Start Time [SpinBox "Seq."]:
Active only in Manual Mode.
Specifies the individual start time for this scene from the beginning of the entire animation (in seconds).
A value of 0 (displayed as "Seq.") means the scene will start sequentially after the previous sequential scene finishes (considering the interval, if defined).
Values > 0 mean an absolute start time from the beginning of the animation (plus "Start Delay"). Scenes with individual start times can play concurrently with other scenes (both sequential and other individual ones).
Time [SpinBox]:
Active only in Manual Mode.
Specifies the individual display time for this particular scene (in seconds).
A value of 0 means the "Default Scene Display Time" from global animation settings will be used.
T> (Enable custom interval) [Checkbox]:
Active only in Manual Mode.
If checked, the interval after this scene will be taken from the adjacent SpinBox.
[SpinBox next to T>]:
Active only in Manual Mode and when "T>" is checked.
Specifies the individual pause time (interval in seconds) after this scene is displayed and before the next sequential scene is loaded.
Headers "All Incl.", "All S/H", "All Clr?", "All T>":
Checkboxes in the list header allow for batch checking/unchecking of the respective options for all scenes in the list.
Buttons:
Start: Begins animation playback with the current settings. Also saves the configuration.
Cancel: Cancels configuration and closes the dialog window.
Important notes regarding time modes:
Automatic Mode: Simplified mode where all scenes have the same display time and the same interval between them. Ideal for quick slideshows.
Manual Mode: Gives full control over each scene's time, the interval after it, and allows defining scenes that start at a specific moment in the animation, independently of others (they can overlap). This allows for creating more complex sequences.

Undo (Ctrl+Z): Undoes the last performed action.

Redo (Ctrl+Y): Redoes the last undone action.

Clear (Shift+C): Removes all drawn shapes from the scene. In LoadIMG mode (after loading a background image), it keeps the background image.

KEYS (Ctrl+K): Opens a window with a list of keyboard shortcuts.

BOARD (Alt+\): Switches to whiteboard mode (white background, dedicated pen color).

EDIT (RAlt+\ or Ctrl+Alt+\): Switches to edit mode (transparent background for drawing on existing desktop elements, dedicated pen color).

TEMP (Alt+Shift+\): Switches to temporary drawing mode (shapes disappear after a set time).

DRAW (Ctrl+\): Toggles normal drawing mode.

4. Overview of Drawing Modes

The program has several main operating modes:

Normal Draw (Default Drawing Mode):

Activated by the DRAW button or Ctrl+\ shortcut.

Uses settings from the upper part of the panel (Transparency, Thickness, Draw Color, etc.).

The "Dimm" option can dim the background.

Shapes are permanent until deleted or cleared.

BOARD Mode:

Activated by the BOARD button or Alt+\ shortcut.

Simulates a whiteboard. By default, the background is white (can be changed with the "Color (Board BG)" button).

Uses a dedicated pen color ("Color (Board Pen)").

"Dimm" option and indicators work according to global settings.

Shapes are permanent.

Exiting the mode (e.g., via Esc x2) may ask to clear the board.

EDIT Mode:

Activated by the EDIT button or RAlt+\ (or Ctrl+Alt+\) shortcut.

Intended for drawing on existing desktop content. The background is transparent.

Uses a dedicated pen color ("Color (Edit Pen)").

After loading a background image (LoadIMG), the program automatically switches to this mode.

Other functions are as in BOARD mode.

TEMP Mode (Temporary Mode):

Activated by the TEMP button or Alt+Shift+\ shortcut.

Drawn shapes disappear automatically after the time set in the "Time (s)" field.

Uses a dedicated pen color ("Color (Temp)").

Useful for quick, temporary annotations.
